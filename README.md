Advanced CSS with SASS project based on the Jonas Schmedtmann's tutorial and website design (Udemy course 'Advanced CSS and SASS'). 
It features all the modern CSS tricks such as 'clip-path', 'background-clip', 'shape-outside', background-blend-mode', 'backdrop-filter' and many more. 
It is built according to 'the 7-1' pattern principle (7 folders  with scss files). Fully responsive. I have learnt a lot following this tutorial.
